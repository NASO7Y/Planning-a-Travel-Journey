# Planning a Travel Journey

An interactive application that enables users to explore direct and indirect travel routes between various cities using car, train, or plane. This project integrates Prolog for knowledge representation and Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).


## Features

- **Direct Route Checking**: Determine direct travel routes between cities.
- **Indirect Route Identification**: Discover indirect travel paths through intermediate stops.
- **Multiple Transportation Modes**: Choose between car, train, and plane options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact through a GUI built with Tkinter.
- **Visual Results**: View clear, color-coded travel results in a separate window.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NASO7Y/Planning-a-Travel-Journey.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Planning-a-Travel-Journey
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   - Ensure you have [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) installed for running Prolog scripts.
   - Install Python dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install tkinter
     ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Prolog knowledge base**:

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run SWI-Prolog:

     ```bash
     swipl
     ```

   - Load the Prolog script:

     ```prolog
     ?- [project].
     ```

2. **Launch the GUI**:

   - In a separate terminal, navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the Python GUI script:

     ```bash
     python gui.py
     ```

3. **Interact with the Application**:

   - Use the GUI to select cities and transportation modes.
   - View the results displayed in a new window.
