# Travel_Journy
The Ultimate Travel Checker is an interactive application that allows users to check direct and indirect travel routes between various cities using different modes of transportation (car, train, or plane). This project combines Prolog for knowledge representation and Python (Tkinter) for the graphical user interface.
