# Travel_Journy
The Ultimate Travel Checker is an interactive application that allows users to check direct and indirect travel routes between various cities using different modes of transportation (car, train, or plane). This project combines Prolog for knowledge representation and Python (Tkinter) for the graphical user interface.

Features

Check for direct travel routes between cities.

Identify indirect travel paths via intermediate stops.

Supports three modes of transportation: car, train, and plane.

User-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

Clear, color-coded travel results displayed in a separate window.

Structure : 
```ultimate-travel-checker/
├── project.pl       # Prolog knowledge base
├── gui.py    # Python script for the GUI
├── calm.jpg             # Background image for the GUI
└── README.md            # Documentation
└── requirements.txt     # Requirements Python Libraries
└── report.pdf         # report containing everything in the project
```


Future Improvements: 

Expand the knowledge base to include more cities and routes.

Implement advanced pathfinding algorithms for multi-step travel.

Add error handling for invalid inputs.

Deploy as a standalone executable using PyInstaller.
